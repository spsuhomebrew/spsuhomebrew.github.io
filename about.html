			The Homebrew Computer Club is a hacking club in its truest form. We explore and reverse engineer computer systems in order to gain a better understanding of how they work. 
			Each semester we take on a fun, challenging project and have a presentation about it at the beginning of the next semester. 
			We like to keep our projects very open and modular, so that anyone can contribute no matter their skill level.  
			We typically use C, C++, Assembly, and some Machine Code.  For scripting and project tools we use C++, Java, and Python.  
			We will also begin working with hardware and circuit design this semester.
			We're always open to using new technologies and could certainly use some Software Engineers for better project organization, so no matter what your skills are, we can make it work.
