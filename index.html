			<h3>C Compiler (in progress)</h3>
	
			We chose to write a compiler for the Gameboy Color, with the ultimate goal of the project being to gain a better understanding and appreciation for the compiler process as a whole (and to have fun of course). Currently, we have just finished writing the Lexer,Preprocessor, and Parser. 
			The project is hosted on our github for viewing, using CMake for building.

		<h3>Space Invaders Emulator - Fall 2017</h3>

		Inspired by the incredible engineers who came before us, we wanted to work on a project involving assembly. 
		Most of the time working on this project was spent flipping through the Intel 8080 datasheet and carefully debugging to find any errors in my opcode implementation. 
		Initially we used OpenGL for graphics, but later we switched to SDL 2. SDL2 has controller and audio handling, plus it seemed more fitting for rendering from a 2D bitmap.
		We successfully completed and presented this project in January 2018.
